      <h2>Checkpoint 5 — Los Angeles (Finish)</h2>
      <p>
        LA appears like a mirage made of billboards and warm air. Your hands smell like steering wheel.
        Your brain is half coffee. Your soul is half “I can’t believe that worked.”

            <p class="small">
              You cross the finish line and the city doesn’t even notice—because the city is busy being LA.
              But your crew notices. The stopwatch notices. The universe notices, and for once, it doesn’t argue.
              <br><br>
              People will say it was the car, the route, the luck. They’re wrong.
              It was you deciding, finally, to be ridiculous on purpose—without becoming a cautionary tale.

            <b>ENDING 2: YOU FINISH — BUT NOT THE RECORD.</b>
            <p class="small">
              You did it. Coast to coast. Not a myth, not a group chat fantasy—real miles, real hours.
              The record stays unbroken, sitting up there like a smug statue.
              <br><br>
              But you finish with the car intact and your story intact, which is rarer than it sounds.
              You didn’t win the legend. You became your own version of it.
            </p>
            <p class="small"><a href="index.html">Try again</a> (one cleaner choice can change the math… unless the universe does something petty).</p>

          <div id="endDNF" class="danger" style="display:none;">
            <b>ENDING 3: DNF — YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP.</b>
            <p class="small">
              It happens fast. Not dramatic like a movie—just one moment where reality pulls the emergency brake, and you have to pull over. Maybe it’s a mechanical failure, maybe it’s a cop, maybe it’s the heat. Maybe it’s all three, because the universe loves a combo move. 
              <br><br>
              You sit on the shoulder, watching the horizon keep moving without you.
              The dream doesn’t die. It just gets heavier.
